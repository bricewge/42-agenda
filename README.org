** Credentials
To use the sripts which use the api you need to setup your credentials as
explained [[https://api.intra.42.fr/apidoc/guides/getting_started#create-an-application][here]] and setup your credentials in a file at the root of the repo
named =credentials.yml=. Following is an example of such a file.
#+NAME: credentials.yml

  id: "4242424242424242424242424242424242424242424242424242424242424242"
